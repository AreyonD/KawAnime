# _KawAnime_

Disclaimer : This is a software for otaku/anime-fans. Do not try if you're not prepared.

This software allows one to: 
* Be aware of the latest anime release.
* Download an anime via Torrent (one would need a torrent client for the moment).
* Get information from any anime (those come from myanimelist.net).
* Get anime-related news from MyAnimeList.net.
* More features are to come

This is a software developped with Electron framework. It is still in development. 

## About OS
* For the moment, kawAnime fully works only on Mac OS X.
* On Linux, the torrents will start only if your client is defined as the default action for torrent files.
* On Windows, the torrent client will start but it seems not with the torrent files you asked fo, you can find your 
torrents in
`KawAnime/resources/tmp` directory
